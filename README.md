This repository contains my NixOS configurations, along with custom modules and packages. It is modular, declarative, and tailored for multi-device setups.

## üß© Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hosts/         # Machine-specific configurations (workstation and nuc hosts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/       # Atomic functionality units organized by purpose
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profiles/      # Pre-composed collections of modules for quick setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/           # Helper functions that make Nix life easier
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlays/      # Package customizations

### Key Features

- **Multi-architecture Support** - Optimized for both x86_64 and aarch64 systems
- **AMD Hardware Support** - Optimized for AMD CPUs and GPUs
- **NUC Hardware Support** - Optimized for Intel NUC-based homelab servers
- **GNOME Desktop** - Sleek, customized GNOME environment with carefully selected extensions
- **Impermanence** - System state persistence where you want it, fresh boots where you don't
- **Remote Deployment** - Build on powerful machines, deploy to resource-constrained devices
- **Application Suite** - Curated selection including Firefox, Discord, 1Password, and more
- **Secure Boot** - Lanzaboote integration for secure system startup (see modules/core/boot.nix)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Switch to workstation configuration
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#workstation

# Deploy to a NUC using deploy-rs
deploy .#nuc-juno
```

### Remote Deployment

This repository uses [deploy-rs](https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs) for remote deployment, which builds the system on the more powerful workstation and deploys to the target machines.

```bash
# Build and deploy juno configuration
deploy .#nuc-juno

# Apply to all nodes
deploy .

# Check what would be deployed without deploying
deploy . --dry-run

# Deploy to specific nodes
deploy .#nuc-juno .#nuc-luna
```

### Customizing for Your Machine

1. Create a new directory in `hosts/` with your machine's name
2. Set up hardware configs in `hosts/your-machine/hardware/`
3. Create a `default.nix` that imports the modules and profiles you need
4. Add your machine to `flake.nix` under `nixosConfigurations`
5. Optionally add your machine to the deploy-rs configuration in parts/deploy.nix

## üß∞ Working with Modules

Modules are the building blocks of this configuration. They're organized by function:

- **core/** - Essential system settings (boot, shell, locales)
- **hardware/** - Hardware-specific configurations (CPU, GPU, networking)
- **desktop/** - UI environments and customizations
- **services/** - System services (audio, SSH, YubiKey)
- **applications/** - User-facing apps
- **users/** - User account configurations

Adding a new module is as simple as creating a .nix file in the appropriate directory and importing it where needed!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

1. **Composable** - Mix and match modules to build exactly what you need
2. **Discoverable** - Clear organization makes finding and understanding configs easy
3. **Maintainable** - Small, focused modules with clear purposes
4. **Reproducible** - Same config = same result, every time
5. **Upgradable** - Flakes pin inputs for deterministic builds while making updates straightforward
6. **Consistent** - Standardized code style and patterns across all modules

## üìö Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory:

- **[Getting Started](./docs/README.md)** - Quick start guide for new users
- **[Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and structure
- **[Adding Hosts](./docs/ADDING_HOSTS.md)** - Step-by-step host setup
- **[Deployment](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Deployment procedures
- **[Secret Management](./docs/SECRETS.md)** - YubiKey and agenix setup
- **[Troubleshooting](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Common issues and fixes
- **[Backup & Recovery](./docs/BACKUP_RECOVERY.md)** - Data protection

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Quality Tools

- **Style Checker**: Run `./scripts/check-style.sh` to validate code style
- **Module Generator**: Use `./scripts/new-module.sh` to create new modules
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Install with `pre-commit install` for automatic checks
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated quality checks on all pull requests

### Creating New Modules

```bash
# Create a new service module
./scripts/new-module.sh service nginx web

# Create a new application module
./scripts/new-module.sh app firefox desktop

# Create a new hardware module
./scripts/new-module.sh hardware gpu-nvidia
```

### Code Style

All modules must follow our [Style Guide](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md). Key points:
- Use explicit `lib.` prefix instead of `with lib;`
- Include module header comments
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add proper documentation and examples
